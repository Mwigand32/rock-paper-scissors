Rock Paper Scissors Project

This project shows a single-player variant of Rock, Paper, Scissors that can be played in a web browser. The code in this project is meant to practice very simple JavaScript functionality, and will later also combine JavaScript with HTML and CSS to make all of these technologies work together.
